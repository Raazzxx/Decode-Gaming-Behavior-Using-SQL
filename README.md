 # Project Overview
 The project **“Decode Gaming Behavior"** is a journey of exploration, analysis, and discovery. 

 Through the effective utilization of SQL (Structured Query Language) and a comprehensive data analysis approach, we will be trnsforming gaming data into valuable 
 insights that hold the potential to drive strategic decisions and optimize gaming experiences.

 Throughout this project, we will achieve following key milestones:
 - Data Cleaning
 - Data Transformation
 - Data Manipulation
 - Finding key performance metrics
 - Player analysis
 - Player Behavior analysis

 # Data Source
   The project utilizes an extensive gaming dataset, encompassing player interactions, in-game purchases, and session logs. The dataset is available in the 'data' directory.

 # SQL Queries and Analysis
   1. Player Engagement Analysis
      Evaluate player engagement metrics (e.g., daily active users, retention rates) to discern user commitment and identify potential churn factors.
   2. In-Game Purchases
      Analyze purchasing patterns, average transaction values, and popular items to optimize monetization strategies and enhance the in-game economy.
   3. Session Behavior
      Explore session duration, frequent activities, and user paths to identify popular game features and potential areas for improvement.
   4. User Segmentation
      Segment players based on gameplay preferences, skill levels, and spending habits, providing targeted insights for personalized gaming experiences.

# Technical Skills Applied
 - **Database Management:** Setting up and managing databases for efficient data retrieval.
 - **SQL Querying:** Proficient use of SQL for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
 - **SQL Queries Used:** Alter Command, CTE, Window Function, Procedures.
